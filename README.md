🛠️ A Network Packet Analyzer Tool!

🌐 As Part Of My Ongoing Cybersecurity Internship At Prodigy InfoTech, I've Been Working On A Fascinating Project - Developing A Network Packet Analyzer Tool.

🖥️ This Innovative Tool Captures And Analyzes Network Packets, Providing Insights Into Source And Destination IP Addresses, Protocols, And Payload Data. With A User-Friendly Interface, It Offers A Seamless Experience For Users To Monitor Network Traffic And Identify Potential Security Threats.

🛠️ Leveraging Python And The Powerful Scapy Library, I've Implemented Packet Sniffing Capabilities And Integrated A Sleek GUI Using Tkinter. Additionally, I've Enhanced The Tool To Save Captured Packet Information Into A .txt File For Further Analysis And Reference.

👨‍💻 This Project Has Been An Incredible Learning Experience, Allowing Me To Deepen My Understanding Of Network Protocols, Packet Manipulation Techniques, And Ethical Hacking Principles. I'm Thrilled To Contribute To Cybersecurity Initiatives And Hone My Skills In This Dynamic Field.
